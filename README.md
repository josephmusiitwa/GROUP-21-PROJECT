## 2. Overview

This is a reusable C++ library that implements **Mean Shift clustering**. Clustering means grouping similar data points together without being told the groups in advance. Unlike k-means, Mean Shift does not need you to say how many clusters you want. It finds that number from the data.

You give the library a set of points (for example, rows from a CSV file). It gives back the cluster centres, which points belong to which cluster, and a simple score for how tight the clusters are.

## 3. Objectives

- Implement Mean Shift clustering using C++ classes.
- Keep a clear public interface (headers in `include/`, code in `src/`).
- Load CSV data and scale it (Z-score or Min-Max).
- Test the library with automated tests, including bad input.
- Show how to use it with small example programs.
- Build from a clean machine with CMake.
- Work as a team using Git and GitHub.

## 4. Main features

| Feature | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| Load a CSV file (with or without a header) | `Dataset::loadFromCSV` |
| Z-score scaling (mean 0, standard deviation 1) | `Dataset::standardize` |
| Min-Max scaling (values between 0 and 1) | `Dataset::normalize` |
| Distance between two points | `MeanShift::euclideanDistance` |
| Gaussian kernel weight | `MeanShift::gaussianKernel` |
| Automatic bandwidth estimate | `MeanShift::estimateBandwidth` |
| One mean shift step | `MeanShift::shiftPoint` |
| Run the whole clustering | `MeanShift::fit` |
| Read the clusters and labels | `getClusters`, `getLabels` |
| Cluster quality score | `MeanShift::evaluate` |
| Any numeric type (`short`, `int`, `long`, `unsigned`, `int8_t`, `float`, `double`, `long double`, ...) | `BasicDataset<T>`, `BasicMeanShift<T, R, K>` |

## 6. Requirements

- Git
- CMake 3.15 or newer
- A C++ compiler that supports C++23 (we checked with GCC 13)

There are no other dependencies. The library uses only the C++ standard library.

## 7. How to build

```
git clone https://github.com/josephmusiitwa/GROUP-21-PROJECT.git
cd GROUP-21-PROJECT
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

This creates the library `libmeanshift.a` (or `meanshift.lib` on Windows), the three example programs and the test program inside the `build` folder.

## 8. How to use the library

```cpp
#include "meanshift/Dataset.hpp"
#include "meanshift/MeanShift.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    meanshift::Dataset dataset;
    if (!dataset.loadFromCSV("data/input/my_data.csv")) {   // false if the file cannot be opened
        return 1;
    }
    // dataset.standardize();   // optional: Z-score scaling
    // dataset.normalize();     // optional: Min-Max scaling

    meanshift::MeanShift ms(2.0, 1e-3, 300);   // bandwidth, epsilon, max iterations
    ms.fit(dataset.getData());

    for (const auto& cluster : ms.getClusters()) {
        std::cout << "Cluster with " << cluster.pointIndices.size() << " points\n";
    }
    std::cout << "Score: " << ms.evaluate(dataset.getData()) << "\n";
}
```

**What the settings mean:**

- **bandwidth**: how far a point "looks" for neighbours. Small values give many small clusters, large values give a few big ones. If you pass `-1` (the default), the library estimates it.
- **epsilon**: a point stops moving when its step is smaller than this.
- **max iterations**: the most steps a point may take.

**After `fit()`:**

- `getClusters()` gives a list of `Cluster`, each with a `centroid` (the centre) and `pointIndices` (which rows belong to it).
- `getLabels()` gives one cluster number per input row.
- `evaluate()` gives the average distance from each point to its centre. Lower means tighter clusters.
### Using other numeric types

```cpp
meanshift::BasicDataset<int> raw;                 // integer CSV values
raw.loadFromCSV("data/input/students.csv");
meanshift::BasicMeanShift<int> ms(5.0);           // int data, double maths
ms.fit(raw.getData());                            // centroids are BasicPoint<double>

auto scaled = raw.cast<double>();                 // standardize() needs a floating type
scaled.standardize();

meanshift::BasicMeanShift<float, float, meanshift::FlatKernel> flat(0.5f);
flat.fit(scaled.cast<float>().getData());
```

`BasicDataset<int>::standardize()` and `BasicMeanShift<std::string>` are compile errors, and the error message names the concept that failed.

### Data format

CSV files with one point per row and numbers separated by commas. A header row is skipped by default (pass `false` as the second argument if there is no header). Empty lines and values that are not numbers (such as names) are skipped, so `students.csv` can keep a name column.

```
Feature1,Feature2
1.0,1.2
1.5,1.4
8.0,8.1
```

## 9. Examples

| Program | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `example1` | Loads a CSV, clusters it, prints the clusters and writes `Cluster_ID` results to a CSV. |
| `example2` | Clusters 9 points written in the code (no file needed). |
| `example3` | Same as `example1`, but asks you to type the input and output file paths. |

Run them from the project folder:

```
./build/examples/example2
./build/examples/example1 data/input/my_data.csv data/output/results.csv
./build/examples/example3
```

On Windows the programs may be inside `build/examples/Debug/` and end in `.exe`.

Output of `example2`:

```
Number of clusters found: 3
Cluster 0 centroid: (1.50006, 1.35186) with 3 points.
Cluster 1 centroid: (8.47972, 8.33061) with 3 points.
Cluster 2 centroid: (1.52013, 8.30793) with 3 points.
Clustering evaluation score (cohesion): 0.622962
```

Sample data in `data/input/`: `my_data.csv`, `biology_data.csv`, `finance.csv`, `students.csv`, `text_data.csv`.

## 10. How to run the tests

```
cd build
ctest --output-on-failure
```

`tests/test_meanshift.cpp` has two layers:

- **Compile-time tests** (`static_assert`) check that the concepts accept every numeric type and reject `bool`, `char`, `std::string` and pointers. They also check that `standardize()` is unavailable for integer datasets.
- **Typed tests**: each test is a function template run for 13 types (`short` ... `long double`). Together they cover distance (including the unsigned wrap-around case), kernels, shifting, clustering, labels, bandwidth estimation, evaluation, empty data, CSV parsing per type, scaling and the old `double` API. In total there are 865 checks.

Tests that need files create and delete their own temporary CSV, so they can be run from any folder.

## 11. Limitations

- Each step compares a point with every other point, so it gets slow on very large data.
- Kernels are chosen at compile time (template parameter), not at run time.
- The automatic bandwidth is a simple guess (half the average distance between points, using at most the first 500 points).
- `evaluate()` measures only how tight clusters are, not how well separated they are.
- The library does not check that every row has the same number of values. Rows of different length can cause errors.
- The examples write the header `Feature1,Feature2,Cluster_ID`, so the header is wrong if your file has a different number of features.
- `example3` does not accept file paths with spaces.
- The project needs a compiler with C++23 support (concepts and `std::from_chars` for floating-point types are used).
- `long long` values above 2^53 lose precision, because the default compute type for integers is `double`.

## 12. How we collaborated

We were 9 members who had never worked on a shared code project before. Each person took one function or file, worked on their own branch, and opened a pull request on GitHub. A different member reviewed and merged it. We wrote a short report every week in `reports/`.
